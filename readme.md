DuMark's Gallery

Description:

I wanted to create a simple one paged web application that fetches data from a JSON of my making, 
and displays that information. With this I wanted to make an easy user friendly 
interface that allowed it's users to not only add a hero, 
(favorite a hero,) as well as to only display my personal favorites.
