Title:

DuMark's Gallery

## Description:
I wanted to create a simple one paged web application that fetches data from a JSON of my making, 
and displays that information. With this I wanted to make an easy user friendly 
interface that allowed it's users to not only add a hero, 
(favorite a hero,) as well as to only display my personal favorites.

## Features
- **Superhero List**: The main page displays a list of superheroes, including their names and images. Each superhero is listed as an item in the list.
- **Display Superpowers**: Clicking on a superhero's image reveals their special powers. This information is displayed in a dedicated area on the web page.
- **Filter Favorites**: The "DuMark's Faves" button allows users to filter the list to display only DuMark's favorite superheroes. 



## Usage
1. Open the web page in a web browser.
2. View the list of superheroes and their names.
3. Click on a superhero's image to display their superpowers.
4. Click "DuMark's Faves" to filter and display favorite superheroes.



## Development
- The web app is built using HTML and JavaScript.
- It uses the Fetch API to retrieve superhero data from a JSON file that I made.
- Event listeners are used to handle interactions like displaying superpowers and filtering DuMark's favorites.



## Issues
If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or contribute to the project.
